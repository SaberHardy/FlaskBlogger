Before run flask server:
---> export FLASK_DEBUG=development
---> export FLASK_APP=app.py
---> flask --debug run

-----------------Flask create data base ------------
1- Create database model
2- flask shell
3- db.create_all() # this is for create the database from the model
4- use this in your creation of your app

if __name__ == "__main__":
    with app.app_context():
        db.create_all()
        app.run(debug=True)

# If you see a database error you can delete the database and run again:

1- flask shell
2- db.create_all()


------------------- ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'MySQLdb' ------------
This error is for installing:
- pip install pymysql
also:
- pip install cryptography


install mysql in pycharm terminal:
--> pip install mysqlclient

run this command in your computer terminal:
--> sudo killall mysqld
--> sudo apachectl stop

After that you can open the browser on:
---> http://localhost/phpmyadmin/
after that you can create your database

--------------- For Adding new Column in database ---------------
1- Add your name column you want to add (for example school_study)
2- Add the name in the form to render it in the template
3- Edit your code in the app.py:

                [user = Users(name=form.name.data,
                    email=form.email.data,
                    school_study=form.school_study.data)]
4- also: check your code if you need this field or you already used these fields.
In my case i added this field (school_study), in two methods, [add_user, update]
5- Check also the files "".html"", if you need to update something.

After all these steps, in your terminal make sure you are in your terminal and write these commands:
6- pip install Flask-Migrate
7- add importation to "app.py":
    from flask_migrate import Migrate
    # Migrate the app with database
    migrate = Migrate(app, db)

8- In the terminal write:
    - flask db init
    - flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
    # Push all the migrations to database
    - flask db upgrade
9- Run the server to see your new fields
